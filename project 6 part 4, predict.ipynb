       "u'Donald Trump in music refers to songs, albums and bands that refer to Donald Trump and his various brands, including Trump Tower, his TV show, his hotel chain, and his casinos. Though recent songs refer to Trumps campaign and subsequent election as president of the United States, more than 200 songs refer to Trump prior to his successful presidential race between 1989 and 2013. With his win of the 2016 presidential bid, Trumps prominence in rap music has been liked to that of Ronald Reagans in hardcore punk during the 1980s. Background Hip hop Trumps name first appeared in hip hop lyrics during the 1980s when the business mogul became an icon of the ultra rich. Among the earliest mentions of Donald Trump in rap lyrics was the Beastie Boys 1989 track Johnny Ryall in which they pit Donald Trump alongside his homeless alter-ego, Donald Tramp. While many rappers praised Trumps wealth, usually comparing their own financial aspirations or success to that of the billionaire businessman, others have used their music as a platform to criticize Trumps practices and politics. Among the earliest of these was The Coup from Oakland, California who critiqued and mocked Trump on their first two albums released in the early 1990s. ESPNs political site FiveThirtyEight documented that between 1989 and 2014, 19% of song lyrics about Trump were negative while 60% were positive. The 2010s marked a shift in hip hop musicians attitude toward Trump as his presence in the public eye shifted from business tycoon to that of a politician making controversial statements against people of color, Latin American people, and Muslims. Because of hip hops close association with these communities and its reinvigorated politicization with the Black Lives Matter movement, lyrical depictions of Trump rapidly grew to be more disparaging throughout his campaign and subsequent election as President of the United States. Many artists have name-checked Trump in more than one song. Pre-presidency, Rick Ross had the most Trump mentions (9 songs between 2008 and 2015) with Nas running second (7 songs between 1996 and 2012). Other major Trump name-checkers include Migos (6 songs between 2013 and 2016), Young Thug (6 songs between 2013 and 2015), Lil Wayne (5 songs between 2000 and 2012) and Raekwon (5 songs between 1995 and 2012). Mac Miller controversy The numerous references to Trump in lyrics have not gone unnoticed by the billionaire. When Mac Millers 2011 song \"Donald Trump\" became a Billboard hit, Trump released a YouTube video congratulating the rapper: A lot of people are calling me about the Mac Miller rap song. Now, its named \"Donald Trump.\" Maybe you should pay me a lot of money, but it just did over 20 million people, tuning into Mac Miller. So in one way, Im proud of him. I havent actually seen the language ... Probably, its not the cleanest language youve ever heard ... But the \"Donald Trump\" song just hit over 20 million, thats not so bad. Im very proud of him. As the song garnered more plays, Trump took a more aggressive tone and demanded royalties for using his name, thereby starting a feud with Miller. In early 2013, Trump threatened the rapper via a series of exchanges on Twitter: Little @MacMiller, you illegally used my name for your song \\u201cDonald Trump\\u201d which now has over 75 million hits. I want the money not the plaque you gave me! I\\u2019m now going to teach you a big boy lesson about lawsuits and finance. You ungrateful dog! I have more hair than you do and there\\u2019s a slight age difference. In 2015 Trump changed his attitude toward Miller again when he ended an interview with The Hill by praising Millers song as it approached 100 million hits. Other styles of music Outside of hip hop, most lyrical references to Trump have appeared in songs ranging from satires of the billionaire, to outright protest in varying degrees of explicitness. One of the earliest Trump send-ups was the 1990 ballad \"Donald Trump (Black Version)\" written by Prince for fellow Minneapolis act The Time in which singer Morris Day calls himself a black version of Donald Trump, who can use his riches to \"fulfill [a womans] every wish, [and her] every dream\". In 1992 Irish folk-rock group Goats Dont Shave had a #4 hit with \"Las Vegas in the Hills of Donegal,\" which references Trumps casino business in imagining an Irish county that becomes a gambling Mecca. More recently, songs like \"Fergus Laing\" by Scottish folk singer Richard Thompson present thinly veiled references to Trump without mentioning him by name, while songs like \"Fucked Up Donald\" by Canadian punk band D.O.A. are more direct. Many songs attack Trump by mocking his supporters through stereotypical portrayals of their views and lifestyles. Phoenix-based comedian Brian Nissen comedian stars as \"Mullets Over America\" spokesman Dwain in the music video \"Make America Great Again\", while Rocky Mountain Mikes cover of \"Mr. Tangerine Man\" remakes the lyrics to be about Trump, with the songs title alluding to the color of his skin. Sung from the perspective of a xenophobic Trump supporter, the song opens: Hey Mr. Tangerine Man, build a wall for me Im not that bright and dont know that youre not going to Hey Mr. Tangerine Man, keep Muslims away from me With my jingoistic worldview, Ill come following you. In October 2016, author Dave Eggers launched a project slated to release one anti-Trump song each day leading up to 2016s election day. Originally called 30 Songs, 30 Days, Eggers plan was to have each song performed by a different artist, but due to more musicians coming through with songs, it grew to be 40, and then 50 songs in 30 days. Eggers worked on the project with Jordan Kurland with whom he had previously worked on two similar election-related projects. Eggers inspiration for the project came when attending a Trump rally in Sacramento earlier that year. Participating artists included Death Cab for Cutie, Aimee Mann, Bhi Bhiman, Jim James, Franz Ferdinand, Josh Ritter, Thao Nguyen, EL VY, R.E.M., Adia Victoria, Moby, Lila Downs, Mac McCaughan, Tim Bluhm, Vinnie Paz, Jesu, Sun Kil Moon, Filthy Friends, Radioinactive, Sheila Brody, Ani DiFranco, Andrew Bird, Mirah, clipping., Sam Cohen, Blake Hazard, Wesley Stace, Loudon Wainwright III, Cold War Kids, Reggie Watts, Mission of Burma, Bob Mould, Ryan Miller, The Long Winters, Open Mike Eagle, Jimmy Eat World, Kyle Craft, Local Natives, Anthony DAmato, Greg Holden, Laura Gibson, Tim Heidecker, Modern Baseball, Joe Purdy, Rogue Wave and more.
